		\textsc{Expert SDET} at \textit{Align Technology}  \dates{March 2021 – Present}
		
		\textbf{Scalable Infrastructure \& Cloud Automation}
		\is
		\smaller{Built and maintained a highly scalable test execution infrastructure on AWS, automating the provisioning and lifecycle management of thousands of on-demand workers to support the execution of 5M+ UI tests per week}
		\is
		\smaller{Architected a region distribution algorithm to automatically balance load between regions based on current Spot price and availability, after introducing the system, spot instance errors were eliminated while maintaining low costs}
		\is
		\smaller{Implemented a multi-regional, performance-aware upload system to Allure TestOps with auto-switching based on cluster load, reducing performance degradation and enabling in-process uploads for 70\% of test runs}
		
		\textbf{CI/CD Optimization \& DevOps Tooling}
		\is
		\smaller{Engineered and rolled out a custom CI toolkit across 10 AQA teams, standardizing pipelines and improving consistency within the unit}
		\is
		\smaller{Developed a React-based portal for test artifact management, integrating multi-regional S3 storage, AWS Lambda pipelines, and AWS Cognito + Azure AD for secure authorization}
		
		\textbf{Smart Automation \& ML/LLM Integration}
		
		\is
		\smaller{Designed and implemented AI review system based on AWS Stack via Bedrock and SageMaker models, using a custom context extractor powered by AWS Lambda and providing useful comments in 5 minutes after pull request creation}
	
		\is
		\smaller{Implemented a change-based test selection mechanism, optimizing test execution by running only the tests impacted by code changes, resulting in a 30\% ( ~300k\$ annually ) reduction in testing costs}
		
		\is
		\smaller{Introduced a time-optimized test session framework with dynamic per-test timeouts, significantly improving the efficiency and speed of the testing process, leading to an additional 20\% ( ~100k\$ annually ) cost savings}
		
		\is
		\smaller{Built a custom test stability detection mechanism that dynamically determines the need for retries, improving test reliability and reducing false failures, which increased the overall success rate from 70\% to 99\%}
		
		\is
		\smaller{Trained and integrated neural network for object segmentation and detecting elements on WebGL scene via PyTorch and openCV}
		
		\is
		\smaller{Refactored test framework - introduced independent fixtures and plug-ins to collect logs and results, mentoring teammates, helped increase the number of tests from 5k to 18k+}
		
		\textbf{Mock Systems \& Environment Virtualization}

		\is
		\smaller{Implemented mock system, based on AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFront), Docker and Python (aiohttp, flask), which raised the success rate from 40\% to 70\% while enabling one-click state viewing from a browser}
		
		\textbf{Leadership \& Collaboration}
		
		\is
		\smaller{Managed a team of up to 4 SDETs, providing leadership and guidance in the development and enhancement of internal testing systems}

		\is
		\smaller{Scaled the number of automated tests from 100 to over 1,000}
		\is
		\smaller{Developed guidelines and a foundation enabling developers to contribute to automated tests as part of the development lifecycle}
		
		\textbf{Infrastructure}
		\is
		\smaller{Built and maintained a cross-platform testing environment for release smoke testing using a combination of supported systems on VMware}
		\is
		\smaller{Set up automation bots for test progress reporting and assigning duties to responsible team members}
